- Else Enter 2 if you want to Search Vaccines District Wise
    - Check your state_id from list and enter it
    - Then Check your  district_id and enter it
- Now the bot will check for `Free` vaccines available for age group 18+ 
- If Slots are available it will play a notification sound and will sleep for 30 seconds after notifying all centers available
